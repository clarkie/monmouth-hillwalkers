                Monmouth Rambling &amp; Hillwalking Club first started walking
                as a group in 1981. Since then our members have enjoyed walking
                countless miles in and around the Monmouth area. We are lucky to
                have some of the UKâ€™s most beautiful and accessible countryside
                on our doorstep.

                From the town centre you can walk along the Wye Valley, climb
                the Kymin or visit beautiful woodlands.
