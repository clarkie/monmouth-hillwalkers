                Monmouth Rambling &amp; Hillwalking Club first started walking
                as a group in 1981. Since then our members have enjoyed walking
                countless miles in and around the Monmouth area. We are lucky to
                have some of the UK’s most beautiful and accessible countryside
                on our doorstep.
              </p>

                From the town centre you can walk along the Wye Valley, climb
                the Kymin or visit beautiful woodlands.
